          <p><h4>Problem:</h4>  Sam runs 5 days a week. Since he only does laundry every 2 weeks, he often wears running shorts multiple times. He doesn’t know where to put them after he wears them once, so they pile up on his floor and smell gross, especially after a few days.
          </p>
          <p><h4>Solution:</h4>  Intermediate Clothing Cleaning - remove smell and dampness so clothing can be worn again FreshGear allows already worn but not dirty clothing to dry out and return to freshness for re-wear. This also creates a 'home' for clothing worn once, previously homeless because users didn't want to put clothes back in a dresser with clean clothes, or in the hamper where they would get even dirtier.</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
             <p>"If my husbands cereal is on sale I'll buy a few boxes but I don't just buy anything thats on sale"</p><p>"It's a mom-of-the-house chore, gotta feed the family"</p><p>"I don't want to spend half an hour looking for a coupon that's gonna save 50 cents"</p>
             <p>A busy mom has no time to search for and clip coupons, but appreciates a good deal. She will occasionally buy discounted items but only if she thinks the item is going to keep her family happy and healthy. She would love to save more on groceries but doesn’t want to spend more effort on this chore.</p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>The ideas was proposed as a sort of suit bag that treated clothing to reduce smell</p>
            <p>One of our intermediate designs combined a dirty laundry hamper with a once-worn clothing container that included a UV light to kill smell-causing bacteria.</p>
            <p>The final prototype eliminated UV light in order to keep the system energy passive and more user-friendly. Hangs over closet door to move clothes away from the floor, which is perceived as a place for dirty clothes. We built both a looks-like prototype shown here, as well as a works-like protoype that used silica gel to absorb moisture and activated charcoal to reduce semell.</p>
