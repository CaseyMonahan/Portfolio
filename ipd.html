          <p><h4>Problem:</h4>  Sam runs 5 days a week. Since he only does laundry every 2 weeks, he often wears running shorts multiple times. He doesn’t know where to put them after he wears them once, so they pile up on his floor and smell gross, especially after a few days.
          </p>
          <p><h4>Solution:</h4>  Intermediate Clothing Cleaning - remove smell and dampness so clothing can be worn again FreshGear allows already worn but not dirty clothing to dry out and return to freshness for re-wear. This also creates a 'home' for clothing worn once, previously homeless because users didn't want to put clothes back in a dresser with clean clothes, or in the hamper where they would get even dirtier.</p>

            <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
            <p>The ideas was proposed as a sort of suit bag that treated clothing to reduce smell</p>
            <p>One of our intermediate designs combined a dirty laundry hamper with a once-worn clothing container that included a UV light to kill smell-causing bacteria.</p>
            <p>The final prototype eliminated UV light in order to keep the system energy passive and more user-friendly. Hangs over closet door to move clothes away from the floor, which is perceived as a place for dirty clothes. We built both a looks-like prototype shown here, as well as a works-like protoype that used silica gel to absorb moisture and activated charcoal to reduce semell.</p>

          <p>IPD was a collaborative class between Olin, Babson, and Massachusetts College of Art and Design. The aim was to develop a product for “the sustainable home” and produce a looks-like model, a works-like prototype, and a complementary business model.</p>
