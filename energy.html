        <h2>Creating locally-produced electricity systems for Uganda</h2>
        <h4>Electricity is a life-saving resource. Empower Design is educating and co-designing with Ugandan technicians to enable the local manufacturing of energy systems.</h4>

            <p>I worked on this project as part of a class called Affortable Design and Entrepreneurship which enabled students to work on real-world product development for extreme affordability. My team worked in conjuntion with <a href="empowerdesign.org"> Empower Design</a>, a non-profit that partnered with Ugandan technicians at St. Joseph's Technical Institute in Fort Portal, Uganda. My team in Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship worked with our Ugandan partners to design a concentrated solar power system that could be built from materials sourced in Uganda.</p>
            <p>I was in charge of designing a generator that could be made with basic machine shop capabilities and locally available materials. With the help of teammates Amos Meeks and Grace Morton, I constructed two prototype generators for testing.</p>

            <h3>International Co-design</h3>
            <p>This project provided an especially interesting and challenging co-design experience partially because we were working with partners in Uganda over Skype or email, dealing with unreliable internet connections and differences in cultural norms surrounding communication, but also because we were designing systems to be built using Ugandan skills and resources.</p> <p>We had to understand that customers needed increased reliability from electricity systems but we also needed to understand the manufacturing capabilities available in Uganda. Our main goal was to increase the reliability of electricity </p>

            <p>This August I led a workshop to teach the technicians the theory behind axial-disk generators, as well as rules to follow when designing these generators.</p>

          <p>Local Electricity Systems for Uganda: Our team in Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship began a concentrating solar power project, I continued developing generators in independent research</p>
          <p>Partners:  This project has been advised by Dr. Abigail Mechtenberg as part of Empower Design. Work has been done in conjunction with St. Joseph’s Technical Institute in Fort Portal, Uganda. </p>
          <p>Empower Design has been working with St. Joseph’s to collaboratively develop energy systems that can be affordably and effectively manufactured locally in Uganda. My role has been in generator research and design, as well as co-design for a variety of projects, including windpower, hydroelectricity, and thermoelectricity.</p>
